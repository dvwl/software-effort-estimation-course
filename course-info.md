# Software Effort Estimation (PC2544)
Technical Training Provider in Singapore and Malaysia (Fully HRDF Claimable)

## Synopsis
**SBL-Khas  10001577082 (Exp: 17/07/2026)**

Software estimation is an important activity in the software development life cycle which is used to estimate the time and cost required to complete a software project successfully. Estimation is a difficult process to master correctly due to the wide variability between software projects and the uniqueness in the myriad of parameters that contribute to each project. However, it is important in making key strategic business decisions. The timing, return on investment as well as benefit delivered can either make or break a business.

__Course highlights__

Participants will be exposed to the various techniques involved in software estimation covering the broad areas of development effort, testing effort, developer productivity, and schedule estimation. They will learn the best practices in the field with regard to each technique as well as the range of tools they have available for them to use.

## What You Will Learn
- Overview of the key considerations of software estimation
- Various approaches to software estimation
- Software development effort and cost estimation
- Software testing effort estimation
Schedule estimation

## Who Should Attend
Members of a software development team that need to provide a software effort/cost estimation to senior management for the business decision-making process.

## Prerequisite
Participants must be familiar with the basic theory of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and ideally, should have had some experience in writing code.

## Course Methodology
Participants are taught the underlying concepts of each core feature. There will be an opportunity to test participants’ understanding with simple exercises related to the concepts and features demonstrated.
