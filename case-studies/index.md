{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Case Study Collection

These case studies are based on real-world projects (with details anonymized) and provide insights into estimation challenges, approaches, and outcomes across various domains.

### Featured Case Studies

| Case Study | Industry | Project Type | Key Learning |
|------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| [E-commerce Modernization](./ecommerce-modernization/) | Retail | Legacy Migration | Data migration complexity |
| [Cypto Dex Platform](./crypto-dex/) | Financial Technology | New Development | Security and compliance impact |
| [IoT Monitoring System](./iot-monitoring/) | Manufacturing | Embedded/IoT | Technology uncertainty management |

### Learning Objectives

Each case study provides:
- **Project Context**: Business drivers and constraints
- **Estimation Challenges**: Unique difficulties encountered
- **Approaches Used**: Methods and techniques applied
- **Actual Results**: What really happened vs. estimates
- **Lessons Learned**: Key insights for future projects
- **Best Practices**: Recommendations for similar projects

### How to Use These Case Studies

1. **Read the Context**: Understand the business situation and constraints
2. **Analyze the Challenge**: Consider how you would approach the estimation
3. **Compare Approaches**: See what methods were actually used
4. **Study the Results**: Learn from both successes and failures
5. **Extract Lessons**: Apply insights to your own projects

### Case Study Categories

**By Project Type:**
- New Development Projects
- Legacy System Modernization  
- Package Implementation/Customization
- Integration Projects
- Mobile/Web Application Development

**By Industry:**
- Financial Services
- Healthcare and Life Sciences
- Manufacturing and Supply Chain
- Retail and E-commerce
- Government and Public Sector

## Analysis Framework

Use this framework when studying each case:

### 1. Project Characteristics
- What type of project was this?
- What were the key technical and business constraints?
- How complex was the project scope?

### 2. Estimation Approach
- What estimation methods were used?
- How was uncertainty handled?
- What assumptions were made?

### 3. Results Analysis
- How accurate were the estimates?
- What were the main causes of variance?
- What unexpected issues arose?

### 4. Lessons Learned
- What would you do differently?
- What practices should be continued?
- How can similar risks be mitigated?

### 5. Application
- How do these lessons apply to your context?
- What estimation improvements can you implement?
- What should you communicate to stakeholders?
