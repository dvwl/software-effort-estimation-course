- Difficulty adding new features
- High maintenance costs
- Scalability limitations

### Objectives
- Migrate to modern technology stack (ASP.NET Core)
- Improve performance and user experience
- Enable mobile-first design
- Reduce operational costs
- Prepare for future growth

### Constraints
- **Budget**: $10k approved (strict budget for compliance-driven modernization)
- **Timeline**: Must complete before regulatory implementation date
- **Business Continuity**: Zero downtime during migration
- **Team**: Small team, mix of experienced and junior developers (interns)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Estimates Were Exceeded

**1. Data Migration Complexity (on target)**
- **Managed**: Data quality issues in legacy system were addressed early
- **Solution**: Focused on essential data migration only, with manual validation

**2. Integration Challenges (minor overruns)**
- **Managed**: API compatibility issues resolved with simple adapters
- **Solution**: Limited scope to core integrations only

**3. Performance Requirements (minor overruns)**
- **Managed**: Mobile performance and SEO improved incrementally
- **Solution**: Prioritized critical optimizations within budget

**4. Scope Evolution (tight control)**
- **Limited**: Only compliance-driven features and essential reporting added
- **Solution**: Deferred non-essential enhancements to future phases

### Contributing Factors

**Technical Factors:**
- Legacy code quality worse than expected
- Incomplete documentation
- Hidden dependencies discovered late

**Process Factors:**
- Insufficient discovery phase
- Scope creep not well-controlled
- Testing started too late in process

**Human Factors:**
- Junior developers took longer to ramp up
- Key team member left mid-project
- Business stakeholders unavailable for decisions
