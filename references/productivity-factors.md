## Calculating Combined Productivity

### Multiplicative Approach
```
Overall Factor = Factor1 × Factor2 × Factor3 × ... × FactorN
```

### Example Calculation
**Project Profile:**
- Team: 5 experienced developers (1.1)
- Domain: New to team (0.8)
- Technology: Familiar framework (1.1)
- Requirements: Well-defined (1.1)
- Tools: Excellent development environment (1.2)
- Process: Well-implemented Agile (1.1)
- Co-location: Same building (1.0)

**Combined Factor:** 1.1 × 0.8 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.2 × 1.1 × 1.0 = **1.43**

**Base estimate:** 1000 hours  
**Adjusted estimate:** 1000 ÷ 1.43 = **700 hours**

## Industry Benchmarks

### Productivity by 

| Industry | Lines of Code/Person-Day | Factors |

| **Enterprise Applications** | 25-50 | Complex business logic |
| **Systems Programming** | 10-25 | Low-level, performance critical |
| **Embedded Systems** | 5-15 | Hardware constraints, testing |
| **Game Development** | 20-40 | Creative, performance-focused |

### Productivity by Project Type

| Project Type | Relative Productivity | Characteristics |
