## Risk Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify Risks
Use structured brainstorming:
- Review historical project issues
- Analyze current project characteristics
- Consult with stakeholders and experts
- Use risk checklists and templates

### Step 2: Assess Probability and Impact
| Probability | Description | Value |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Very Low | <10% chance | 0.1 |
| Low | 10-30% chance | 0.2 |
| Medium | 30-60% chance | 0.5 |
| High | 60-90% chance | 0.8 |
| Very High | >90% chance | 0.9 |

| Impact | Description | Multiplier |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Negligible | <5% schedule impact | 1.05 |
| Minor | 5-10% impact | 1.1 |
| Moderate | 10-25% impact | 1.25 |
| Major | 25-50% impact | 1.5 |
| Severe | >50% impact | 2.0 |

### Step 3: Calculate Risk Exposure
```
Risk Exposure = Probability × Impact × Base Estimate
```

### Step 4: Develop Mitigation Strategies
For each significant risk:
- **Avoid**: Change approach to eliminate risk
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Insurance, contracts, outsourcing
- **Accept**: Budget for the risk impact

## Quantitative Risk Models

### Monte Carlo Risk Analysis
1. Define probability distributions for each risk
2. Run simulations (1000+ iterations)
3. Analyze results for confidence intervals
4. Determine appropriate contingency levels

### Expected Value Calculation
```
Expected Effort = Base Estimate × Π(Risk Multipliers)
```

### Confidence Interval Approach
| Confidence Level | Contingency |
|------------------|-------------|
| 50% (median) | 0-10% |
| 80% (likely) | 15-25% |
| 95% (conservative) | 30-50% |

## Industry-Specific Risk Factors

- Team velocity changes
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores

### Early Warning Systems
Set thresholds for:
- Cost performance index < 0.9
- Schedule performance index < 0.9
- Defect injection rate > baseline
- Team velocity decline > 20%

### Risk Review Process
- Weekly risk assessment updates
- Monthly risk review meetings
- Quarterly risk strategy reviews
- Post-project risk analysis

## Risk-Adjusted Estimation Template

### Project Risk Assessment Summary
| Risk Category | Count | Avg Multiplier | Combined Effect |
|---------------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Technical | 5 | 1.3 | 1.3 |
| Requirements | 3 | 1.2 | 1.2 |
| Team | 4 | 1.1 | 1.1 |
| Process | 2 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| External | 3 | 1.15 | 1.15 |

### Final Calculation
```
Base Estimate: 1000 hours
Risk-Adjusted: 1000 × 1.3 × 1.2 × 1.1 × 1.0 × 1.15 = 1,970 hours
Contingency: 970 hours (97%)
```
