# Software Estimation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure comprehensive and accurate software estimation. Print this page for use during estimation sessions.

## Pre-Estimation Preparation

### Requirements Clarity
- [ ] **Functional requirements** are documented and reviewed
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements** (performance, security, etc.) are defined
- [ ] **Scope boundaries** are clearly established
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** are specified for major features
- [ ] **Known exclusions** are documented
- [ ] **Assumptions** are explicitly stated

### Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] **Estimation purpose** is clear (budgeting, planning, bidding)
- [ ] **Accuracy expectations** are set with stakeholders
- [ ] **Key constraints** (time, budget, resources) are identified
- [ ] **Success criteria** for the project are defined
- [ ] **Change management process** is established

### Historical Data
- [ ] **Similar projects** data is available and relevant
- [ ] **Team productivity** metrics from past projects
- [ ] **Technology-specific** productivity rates
- [ ] **Defect rates** and rework factors
- [ ] **Environment factors** (tools, processes) are comparable

---

## Estimation Process

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- [ ] **Functional areas** are identified and decomposed
- [ ] **Technical components** are broken down appropriately
- [ ] **Non-development activities** are included (testing, deployment, etc.)
- [ ] **Work packages** are sized appropriately (8-80 hours)
- [ ] **Dependencies** between work packages are identified
- [ ] **Integration effort** is explicitly included

### Size Estimation
- [ ] **Appropriate sizing method** selected (FP, UCP, LOC, etc.)
- [ ] **Complexity factors** are assessed consistently
- [ ] **Reuse opportunities** are identified and quantified
- [ ] **Technology platform** characteristics are considered
- [ ] **Quality requirements** impact on size is assessed

### Effort Calculation
- [ ] **Productivity rates** appropriate for team and technology
- [ ] **Learning curve** effects are considered
- [ ] **Part-time availability** of team members is factored in
- [ ] **Overhead activities** (meetings, admin) are included
- [ ] **Multiple estimation techniques** used where possible
- [ ] **Peer review** of estimates conducted

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- [ ] **Technology maturity** and team familiarity assessed
- [ ] **Integration complexity** with existing systems
- [ ] **Performance requirements** and technical challenges
- [ ] **Third-party dependencies** and their reliability
- [ ] **Data migration** complexity (if applicable)
- [ ] **Security and compliance** requirements

### Project Risks
- [ ] **Requirements stability** and likelihood of change
- [ ] **Resource availability** and potential turnover
- [ ] **Schedule pressure** and its impact on quality
- [ ] **Stakeholder availability** for decisions and reviews
- [ ] **External dependencies** and coordination needs
- [ ] **Organizational change** impact

### Contingency Planning
- [ ] **Risk impact** quantified in terms of effort/schedule
- [ ] **Mitigation strategies** identified for major risks
- [ ] **Contingency percentages** applied based on risk level
- [ ] **Escalation triggers** defined for risk monitoring
- [ ] **Buffer allocation** across project phases

---

## Quality Assurance

### Estimate Validation
- [ ] **Multiple methods** used and compared
- [ ] **Sanity checks** performed (person-days per feature, etc.)
- [ ] **Industry benchmarks** consulted where available
- [ ] **Expert judgment** sought for complex areas
- [ ] **Team consensus** achieved on major estimates
- [ ] **Assumptions documented** and validated

### Documentation
- [ ] **Estimation basis** clearly documented
- [ ] **Assumptions and exclusions** listed
- [ ] **Risk factors** and contingencies explained
- [ ] **Methodology used** described
- [ ] **Key decisions** and trade-offs recorded
- [ ] **Review and approval** process completed

### Communication
- [ ] **Estimate ranges** provided (not just single numbers)
- [ ] **Confidence levels** communicated to stakeholders
- [ ] **Key assumptions** highlighted in presentations
- [ ] **Risk factors** explained to decision makers
- [ ] **Update process** for estimates established
- [ ] **Variance tracking** plan defined

---

## Post-Estimation Activities

### Planning Integration
- [ ] **Project schedule** developed from effort estimates
- [ ] **Resource allocation** planned based on estimates
- [ ] **Budget preparation** includes all estimated costs
- [ ] **Milestone definitions** align with WBS and estimates
- [ ] **Quality gates** incorporated into timeline
- [ ] **Risk mitigation** activities scheduled

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Tracking methods** established for actual vs. estimated
- [ ] **Regular review points** scheduled for estimate updates
- [ ] **Variance thresholds** defined for re-estimation triggers
- [ ] **Lessons learned** process established
- [ ] **Feedback loop** to improve future estimations
- [ ] **Historical data** collection process defined

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Cognitive Biases
- [ ] **Anchoring bias** - not over-influenced by first estimates heard
- [ ] **Optimism bias** - realistic about potential problems
- [ ] **Planning fallacy** - accounting for typical delays and issues
- [ ] **Confirmation bias** - seeking contrary viewpoints
- [ ] **Availability bias** - not over-weighting recent experiences

### Technical Oversights
- [ ] **Integration effort** not underestimated
- [ ] **Testing activities** given adequate time
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements** effort included
- [ ] **Deployment and operations** activities planned
- [ ] **Learning curve** for new technologies accounted for
- [ ] **Rework and iteration** cycles included

### Process Issues
- [ ] **Scope creep** controls in place
- [ ] **Change impact** assessment process defined
- [ ] **Stakeholder involvement** appropriate level maintained
- [ ] **Regular updates** scheduled and conducted
- [ ] **Decision authority** clear for estimate changes
- [ ] **Communication channels** established and maintained

## Estimation Review Checklist

Use this for peer review or self-assessment:

### Completeness
- [ ] All project components are estimated
- [ ] Non-development activities are included
- [ ] Risk factors are assessed and addressed
- [ ] Assumptions are documented and reasonable

### Accuracy
- [ ] Estimates are based on solid data or rationale
- [ ] Multiple estimation methods agree reasonably
- [ ] Industry benchmarks support the estimates
- [ ] Expert review has been conducted

### Usability
- [ ] Estimates support required planning activities
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail for decision making
- [ ] Clear communication of uncertainty and ranges
- [ ] Action plans for high-risk areas

## Emergency Estimation (Time-Constrained)

When estimation time is severely limited, prioritize these activities:

### Minimum Viable Estimate (1-2 hours)
1. **High-level analogy** to similar projects
2. **Rule-of-thumb sizing** (features Ã— average complexity)
3. **Expert gut-check** with experienced team members
4. **Conservative contingency** (40-50% for high uncertainty)
5. **Clear documentation** of limitations and assumptions

### Quick Validation Steps
- [ ] **Order of magnitude** check (does it feel reasonable?)
- [ ] **Resource sanity** check (available team capacity)
- [ ] **Timeline reality** check (business needs vs. estimate)
- [ ] **Risk flag** high-uncertainty areas for later refinement
